### Wiki ###

You can find our wiki at https://github.com/Signbank/FinSL-signbank/wiki

The wiki has useful information considering FinSL-Signbank:
* How to setup FinSL-signbank (pretty detailed guide).
* How to export Glosses from FinSL-signbank to ELAN.

### Summary of setup ###

To install and test FinSL-signbank on linux:

    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    python bin/develop.py migrate
    python bin/develop.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

*   **Configuration**

Before you can get FinSL-signbank working, change some paths in:

    signbank/settings/base.py  
    signbank/settings/development.py                              

* **Dependencies**

    See https://github.com/Signbank/FinSL-signbank/blob/master/requirements.txt

*   **Database configuration**

Once you have created a database, and correctly configured the database in the settings, you are ready to migrate:

    python bin/develop.py migrate

*If you just want to test the application, we recommend using Sqlite3 as the database (as it is easy to set up)*

*   **How to run tests**

Tests are not yet available.

*   **Deployment instructions**

### Translations ###

FinSL-signbank uses djangos translation feature and fetches translatable strings into django.po.

You can create new locales by:

    python bin/develop.py makemessages yourlocale

This creates django.po file for the locale you chose. Write translations inside msgstr:

    msgstr ""
    For example: msgstr "My translation of the text"

This is what the whole thing for one string/text looks like:

```
#!bash

    #. Translators: Button
    #: signbank/dictionary/templates/dictionary/gloss_detail.html:78
    msgid "Delete Sign"
    msgstr ""

```

After you have written your translations, run:

    python bin/develop.py compilemessages yourlocale

This will compile the translations you wrote into django.po to django.mo file.
Remember to restart your server when doing this to make sure the new translations are in use.
